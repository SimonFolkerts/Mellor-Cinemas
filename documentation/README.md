BOOKING

Users can browse the front page and view different movie sessions. 
A session can be selected, upon which the user is either taken to the booking page, or is asked to log in/create an account if they haven't already.
The booking page summarises the movie, and prompts the user to choose a seat or multiple seats and confirm. The seat display only allows the selection of unreserved seats.

ACCOUNT

Users can go to the account page to see their account details and to view any bookings currently active. The options to delete or edit the account are here.
Account deletion should remove any bookings and junctions to seats, entirely erasing the link.

ADMIN

Administrators can log in to the administrator role using the correct credentials.

username: administrator
password: admin

Here the admin can pull up lists of movies and users. The admin can choose to show all showings for a given movie, or show all bookings for a given user.
Movies and showings can be edited or deleted (providing no active dependents), and users and bookings can be deleted.
